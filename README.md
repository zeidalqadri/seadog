- **Risk-aware Testing**: Configurable intensity levels from stealth to aggressive testing
- **Template-based Setup**: JSON configuration templates for quick deployment

## Mission Phases

1. **INFIL** - Initial reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
2. **TARGET** - Target identification and vulnerability assessment  
3. **ASSAULT** - Primary testing execution and data extraction
4. **CONSOLIDATE** - Results validation and quality assurance
5. **EXFIL** - Mission completion and reporting

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### SEADOG Testing Framework

```python
from luxcrepe.tests.mission_framework import MissionOrchestrator
from luxcrepe.tests.base_agent import MissionParameters

# Initialize mission orchestrator
orchestrator = MissionOrchestrator()

# Define mission parameters
mission_params = MissionParameters(
    mission_id="OPERATION_VALIDATION",
    target_urls=["https://example-ecommerce.com"],
    mission_type="COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING",
    threat_level="YELLOW"
)

# Execute mission
results = await orchestrator.execute_mission(mission_params)
```

### SEADOG-Luxcrepe Integration

```python
from luxcrepe.integration import LuxcrepeSEADOGIntegration, IntegrationConfig

# Create integration configuration
config = IntegrationConfig(
    intelligence_enabled=True,
    real_time_monitoring=True,
    test_suite_type="RECONNAISSANCE"
)

# Initialize and run integrated scraping with testing
integration = LuxcrepeSEADOGIntegration(config)

async def main():
    await integration.start_integration()
    
    # Perform scraping with SEADOG validation
    results = await integration.integrated_scrape_with_testing(
        "https://demo-store.com/products",
        enable_testing=True,
        test_intensity="MODERATE"
    )
    
    print(f"Scraped {len(results['scraping_results'])} products")
    print(f"SEADOG validation score: {results.get('validation_score', 'N/A')}")
    
    await integration.stop_integration()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Quick Testing Functions

```python
from luxcrepe.integration import quick_reconnaissance_test
from luxcrepe.validation import validate_api_endpoints

# Quick reconnaissance test
recon_results = await quick_reconnaissance_test([
    "https://demo-store.com",
    "https://api.example.com"
])

# Validate API endpoints
api_validation = await validate_api_endpoints()
```

## Military Communication Standards
