# SEADOG - SEAL-Grade Multi-Agent Test Squad

A military-inspired testing framework for web scraping systems, implementing SEAL team operational principles for comprehensive testing and validation.

## Overview

SEADOG implements a SEAL-grade multi-agent test squad designed to comprehensively test and validate the LuxCrepe web scraping system. The framework uses military operational structure and protocols to ensure thorough, coordinated testing.

## Squad Structure

### Alpha Squad - Command & Control
- **OVERLORD (Mission Commander)** - Strategic command and mission orchestration
- **PROPHET (Intelligence Officer)** - Multi-source intelligence gathering and threat assessment  
- **RADIO (Communications)** - Inter-agent coordination and message routing

### Bravo Fire Team - Direct Action Testing
- **PATHFINDER (Pointman)** - Initial reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning
- **SLEDGEHAMMER (Breacher)** - Stress testing and barrier penetration
- **HAMMER (Assault)** - Core functionality validation and primary mission execution
- **SHARPSHOOTER (Designated Marksman)** - Precision testing and accuracy validation

### Charlie Support Squad - Specialized Operations
- **TECH (Technical Specialist)** - Advanced technical analysis and optimization
- **MEDIC (Recovery Specialist)** - Error recovery and system healing
- **LOGISTICS (Resource Manager)** - Resource management and optimization
- **ENGINEER (Infrastructure)** - Infrastructure analysis and enhancement

### Delta Overwatch Squad - Intelligence & Recovery
- **GHOST (Stealth Tester)** - Covert operations and stealth testing
- **EAGLE (Monitoring)** - Continuous monitoring and surveillance
- **PHOENIX (Recovery)** - System recovery and resilience testing
- **SAGE (Analytics)** - Deep analytics and pattern recognition

## Key Features

- **Military-Standard Protocols**: Challenge-response authentication, SITREP reporting, 9-Line emergency procedures
- **ML-Enhanced Testing**: Hybrid rule-based + AI approaches for intelligent test execution
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Edge cases, stress testing, accuracy validation, performance analysis
- **Real-time Coordination**: Advanced inter-agent communication and mission orchestration
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Progressive insight building and error decorrelation

## Mission Phases

1. **INFIL** - Initial reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
2. **TARGET** - Target identification and vulnerability assessment  
3. **ASSAULT** - Primary testing execution and data extraction
4. **CONSOLIDATE** - Results validation and quality assurance
5. **EXFIL** - Mission completion and reporting

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
from luxcrepe.tests.mission_framework import MissionOrchestrator
from luxcrepe.tests.base_agent import MissionParameters

# Initialize mission orchestrator
orchestrator = MissionOrchestrator()

# Define mission parameters
mission_params = MissionParameters(
    mission_id="OPERATION_VALIDATION",
    target_urls=["https://example-ecommerce.com"],
    mission_type="COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING",
    threat_level="YELLOW"
)

# Execute mission
results = await orchestrator.execute_mission(mission_params)
```

## Military Communication Standards

- **SITREP**: Situation reports with standardized format
- **9-Line**: Emergency reporting protocol
- **Challenge-Response**: Authentication and verification
- **FLASH/IMMEDIATE/PRIORITY/ROUTINE**: Message priority system

## Intelligence Sources

- **OSINT**: Open Source Intelligence (domain analysis, technology fingerprinting)
- **SIGINT**: Signals Intelligence (network traffic analysis)
- **TECHINT**: Technical Intelligence (anti-bot measures, rate limiting)
- **HUMINT**: Human Intelligence (user behavior patterns)
- **ELINT**: Electronic Intelligence (system monitoring)

## Testing Capabilities

- Precision testing and edge case detection
- Stress testing and boundary condition analysis
- Rate limiting circumvention and barrier penetration
- Data integrity verification and quality assurance
- Performance optimization and scalability analysis
- ML-enhanced extraction and validation
